# TRY N’ SEA!

Attempting to fled the city to escape starvation, poverty and the country’s economic crisis,
Namos and his daughter prepared the money, packed the bags and went to the rocky coast
waiting for the boat to sail across the sea and settle in the Cyprus shores hoping for a secured
future.

Not being aware of what circumstances they might face during their transfer, and how
menacing the crossing could be! Namos and his daughter travelled by the sea with 98 other
passengers, having 150 food crates and 5 gallons of fuel. Their sailboat ended up stranded in
the middle of the sea with so many life decisions to be made!

Join Namos in his journey and help him and the entire team do the right things so that they can
smuggle out of the country and land safely despite the hardships.

## Nota Bene: While playing, be attentive to the game variables, they will accommodate you to make a sound choice!
